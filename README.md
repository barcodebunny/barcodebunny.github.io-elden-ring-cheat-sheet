# Complications

Because of the open-world nature of this game, I have had issues thinking of ways to format the logical area progression and locale information.
The most up-to-date info here is in the form of armament/armour checklists and achievements, and I'm working on adding locations for every important collectible.  
The idea is to have a concise checklist for everything one might want to collect during a playthough, such as:  
<ul>
  <li>Golden Seed locations</li>
  <li>Memory Stone locations</li>
  <li>Sacred Tear locations</li>
  <li>Armament locations</li>
  <li>Talisman locations</li>
  <li>Achievement requirements and associated locations</li>
  <li>Armor locations</li>
  <li>Ashes of War Locations</li>
  <li>Summoning Ashes Locations</li>
</ul> etc etc.

# Contributing to the cheat sheet

At some point, I may open this site to contribution from others. I'm currently working on fixing links and adding locations, 
but as this game is **enormous**, I certainly wouldn't ignore help if it were offered <3.  
I will add a proper contribution guide if this garners interest. But for now, I need to fix the javascript to facilitate
proper progress logging, and format the site in a readable way.
